# Introduction 

With the rise of the internet, the purchase of newspaper is in the decline. This is because not many people is willing to pay for things. With other forms of consuming news such as television and the internet, advertisers are more unwilling to pay newspapers to advertise their content. 1991 is when the internet went live to the world. Internet speed was not great then. At the turn of the century, internet speed went up and peoples prefrence from reading the news from the newspapers or telivision channels to reading the news from the internet. Advertisers have moved their ads online where they can get a bigger reach of people. Even traditional news outlet starts to move online as the way people consume news change.
